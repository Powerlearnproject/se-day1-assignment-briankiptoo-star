Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the implementation of well defined principles and practices to the development of software systems.
IMPORTANCE
It ensures that software is of the higest quality and are reliable and efficient.
Drives technological advancements by enabling the development of complex and sophisticated systems.
It makes sure that software is maintanable.
It ensures that software is scalable to a large client base.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference - Marked the formal recognition of software engineering as a discipline.
1970s Structured Programming - Introduced methodologies like top-down design and modular programming, improving code quality and maintainability.
1990s Agile Manifesto - Revolutionized software development with a focus on iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Idea creation - This phase deals with coming up with ideas that solve a specific problem.
Requirement analysis - This phase deals with checking what is needed to develop the software and acquiring the necessary resources.
Product design - In this phase, the software engineer designs the product so as to know what it will look like.
Product development - In this phase, the actual coding of the software takes place.
Intergration - The product is brought together and becomes functional.
Deployment - The product is now live for other people to use.
Maintanance - The product is improved over time using feedback from people who have used the software and according to changing circumstances.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

In the Waterfall methodology, each phase must be completed before the next begins while in Agile methodoloy, development is done in small managable increments.
Waterfall methodology is appropriate for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes like constuction software while Agile methodology appropriate for projects requiring flexibility and frequent feedback like web applications.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

The software developer writes and debugs code for the software product , the quality assurance engineer ensures the software is of the hihest quality through testing while a project manager oversees the project, ensuring it stays on track, within budget, and meets deadlines.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide comprehensive facilities for software development like debugging and editing e.g Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text.
VCS is used to manage changes to source code over time. They also provide collaboration tools e.g Github.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenges with team collaboration - Develop good communication skills.
Changing requirements - Use Agile methodology.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing - Tests individual components or modules.
Integration Testing - Ensures that combined components work together.
System Testing - Validates the complete and integrated software system.
Acceptance Testing - Confirms the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

This is the process of creating inputs for A.I that produces that generate the required outputs.
IMPORTANCE
Reduces the number of iterations needed to get the desired result.
It leads to accurate responses.
It enhances user experience.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague : Tell me about computers.
Improved: Give me an explanation on the key features of a smartphone.

Improvements
Clear - Smartphone not just computers.
Specific - Key features
Concise - Asks for an explanation.
